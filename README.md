## for developers

### adding new features

1. create a new feature file in `/features/` that exports `enable()` and `disable()` functions:

```lua
-- features/yourFeature.lua
return {
    enable = function()
        -- your feature logic here
    end,
    
    disable = function()
        -- cleanup logic here
    end
}
```

2. add your feature to `config.lua`:

```lua
{
    id = "yourFeature",
    name = "Your Feature",
    description = "What your feature does",
    path = "features/yourFeature.lua",
    enabled = true
}
```

3. your feature will automatically load and integrate with the suite
